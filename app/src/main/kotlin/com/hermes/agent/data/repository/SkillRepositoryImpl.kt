# Document to Action Items

Turn a document, email thread, or meeting transcript into cited facts and
proposed actions. Extraction is not legal or financial advice; ambiguous or
low-confidence passages stay visible rather than being resolved silently.

Adapted from the upstream hermes-agent `document-to-action-items` skill for
the Android tool set.

## When to use
- "Extract the deadlines and obligations from this."
- "Turn this report / transcript into tasks."
- "What are the follow-ups and who owns them?"

## Procedure
1. **Read the source.** `read_file` for a local file; otherwise work on the
   pasted text. Note the version/date and whether it looks complete.
2. **Classify the content.** Separate: parties/people, dates and deadlines,
   money/quantities, obligations ("must" / "should" / "may" — do not collapse
   them), approvals, risks and exceptions, and anything unreadable or unclear.
3. **Validate internally.** Cross-check dates, totals, and repeated names.
   Surface contradictions instead of picking one.
4. **Draft the actions.** For each actionable item: outcome, owner (only if
   stated — otherwise `unresolved`), due date (only if stated), dependency,
   and a citation back to the source line/section. Never invent an owner or date.
5. **Confirm before writing.** Show the structured facts, the high-risk items,
   the low-confidence fields, and the proposed tasks. Only after the user
   approves, create them with `todo` (or `calendar` for dated items, `memory`
   for durable facts). Read the records back and confirm.

## Output shape
```
## Facts
- <fact> (source: <where>)

## Proposed tasks
- [ ] <outcome> — owner: <name|unresolved> — due: <date|unresolved> (source: <where>)

## Needs a human

# Humanizer: remove AI-writing patterns

Rewrite text so it doesn't read as machine-generated. Condensed from the
upstream hermes-agent `humanizer` skill (itself based on Wikipedia's
"Signs of AI writing"). Apply it to the user's text on request, and to your
own user-facing prose (release notes, summaries) as a final pass.

## Task
1. Scan for the patterns below.
2. Rewrite the problem sentences — keep the meaning, drop the tell.
3. If the user gave a writing sample, match its sentence length, word level,
   and punctuation habits. Otherwise aim for varied, plain, opinionated prose.
4. Final check: "what still makes this sound AI-written?" — fix that, once more.
5. Always show the rewrite (a diff for file edits).

## Patterns to remove
- **Puffed-up significance:** "stands/serves as a testament to", "plays a vital/pivotal role", "marks a turning point", "reflects a broader trend", "leaves an indelible mark".
- **Notability padding:** "has been cited in leading outlets", "maintains an active social media presence".
- **Fake-depth "-ing" tails:** "..., highlighting/underscoring/reflecting/ensuring/showcasing X" bolted onto a sentence.
- **Brochure language:** "nestled in the heart of", "boasts a", "vibrant", "rich cultural heritage", "breathtaking", "must-visit", "renowned for".
- **Weasel attribution:** "experts believe", "observers have noted", "industry reports suggest" with no named source.
- **Formulaic "Challenges and Future Prospects" sections.**
- **AI vocabulary:** delve, tapestry, underscore, testament, intricate, pivotal, landscape (abstract), showcase, foster, garner, crucial, robust, seamless, leverage, "it's worth noting", "in a world where", "at the end of the day", "game-changer", "deep dive", "lean into", "unpack".
- **Copula avoidance:** "serves as / represents / stands as a" where "is" would do.
- **Negative parallelism:** "It's not just X, it's Y", "Not only... but also...", and clipped tail negations ("no guessing", "no wasted motion").
- **Rule-of-three everywhere**, em-dash overuse, and every paragraph the same length.
- **Hedging throat-clearing:** "It's important to note that", "That said,", "Ultimately,".

## Keep
Real specifics, concrete numbers, a point of view, uneven sentence lengths,
and the author's actual claims. Removing bad patterns is half the job — the
rewrite still needs a voice.
